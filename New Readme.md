<!-- OVERVIEW -->
## Overview

<p style="font-size:16px;">Hello everyone! For easy reading, I've broken the rules up into bite-sized sections. Feel free to skim past any sections you know already. Please let me know if you have any questions.</p>

### What Is a Repository?

A repository is what you are looking at right now! It's a central location where you can keep all of your files.

<img src="02 Documentation\00 Assets\README\repository_def.png" alt="Logo" width="500"></img>

In the case of GitHub, we can all contribute to this same repository to track and synchronize our work, even when we're apart.

### How Will the Repository Be Used?

If you're brand new to GitHub, hereâ€™s what you need to know.

You can interact with this repository <a href="#what-does-remote-mean">remotely through browser</a> or <a href="#what-does-local-mean">locally through your machine</a> via the GitHub Desktop application.

You will make changes to the repository through <a href="#committing">**commits**</a> and <a href="#pull-requests">**pull requests**</a>.

<br></br>

<!-- COMMITTING -->
## Committing

### What Is Committing?
Everytime you make changes to your repository, it is called a "commit."

Commits can be thought of as a 'Save Game' function.

<img src="02 Documentation\00 Assets\README\quicksave_meme.png" alt="Logo" width="400"></img>

In the case of GitHub, they act as these little snapshots of your respository at specific times in its progression.

Just like in a video game, you should "save" your progress often by making new commits. This helps you and team members keep track of updates.

Additionally, in the event of project issues, you can roll back changes and return to a previous version of your project.

### How Do I Commit?

There are two ways to commit to the GitHub:
1. Remotely through your browser
2. Locally from your machine

<br></br>

## Remote vs. Local

### What Does Remote Mean?
"Remote" refers to a version of your project that is stored on a server everyone has access to (namely, the GitHub website).

It's like a shared Google Docs file versus a personal Word Doc. The remote repository is the shared Google Document that all team members can collaborate on in real time.

### What Does Local Mean?
In contrast, "Local" surrounds the idea of everything that is locally available to *you* and only you. In other words, your personal machine.

In the same analogy used before, the local repository would be the Word Doc. You can sync the two repositories, which is done through pushing and pulling. But no one can edit your version of the repository that is on your computer.

<br></br>

## Uploading Things / Making Changes

### I Want to Upload Files Through My Browser (Remote)

To commit remotely, visit [this repository](https://github.com/Atomic-Atlas/MaS) on [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) and upload files to the correct folders. Be sure to enter the title and description of your change.

### I Want to Upload Files From My Computer (Local)

To commit locally, use the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/) application.

It follows a very similar process, although it actively tracks your changes on your computer, and shows the difference between the remote repository (what's on the GitHub website) and the local repository (your machine).

<img src="02 Documentation\00 Assets\README\ghd_changes.png" alt="Logo" width="400"></img>

In the upper-left corner, right beneath the repository name, you will find the changes you have made. Like the last method, you will be prompted for a title and description of your changes.



<br></br>

## Committing Guidelines

### Title and Description
Regardless of which method you choose, you will always be prompted for a title and description of your changes. PLEASE, for your sake and everyone else's, add a description!

### Template
Here is a template of what you might enter when you are making changes to the repository.




Adding a description will...
1. Eliminate the risk of forgetting what you were doing
2. Inform others of your changes (that way you don't have to reexplain yourself when you may be unavailable).
3. Make it easy to rollback changes.

Programmers, I would recommend you guys create forks of projects when making edits. This is because our implementation is what affects the stability of the game.



If you have a suggestion that would make this better, please fork the repo and create a pull request. You can also simply open an issue with the tag "enhancement".
Don't forget to give the project a star! Thanks again!

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request
